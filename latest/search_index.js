    "text": "A 2d/3d rigid body dynamics solverThe main goal of this repository is to construct a rigid body-joint system and solve forward/backward dynamics problem on it. This package is functioned throughconstructing 2d/3d rigid body-joints system\nsolving motions on unconstrained degrees of freedom(passive joints)\nsolving forces on constrained degrees of freedom(active joints)\nplotting/making gif in Julia or making movies in MatlabTo solve a rigid body dynamics problem, this package express the dynamics using 6D spatial vector developed by Roy Featherstone. The governing equations are formulated to fit in half explicit Runge-Kutta method on index-2 differential equations. Constrained forces on joints are represented in Lagrange multiplier terms and solved together with motions of all degrees of freedom.Based on the calculation of dynamical systems, Dyn3d can also be used to simulate fluid-structure interaction problems using package Whirl, with strongly coupled method(finished) and fully coupled method(to be done)."

    "text": "Before running any dynamics, we need to construct the body-joint system, connecting bodies by joints in the correct hierarchy using supplied configuration information. In order to do that, three key functions are used:AddBody(id::Int, cb::ConfigBody)\nAddJoint(id::Int, cj::ConfigJoint)\nAssembleSystem(bs, js, sys)which is responsible for add a body to the body system, add a joint to the joint system and assemble the body-joint system and fill in extra hierarchy information. These three functions are also bundled in the correct sequential order inBuildChain(cbs, cjs, csys)In order to solve for the rigid body-joint chain system, we choose body velocity v and joint displacement qJ as main variables in the time marching scheme. We also need to construct a structure that stores and updates the body-joint chain\'s intermediate variables such as all kinds of transformation matrices X, body position in the inertial space x_i and so on. All information of the body-joint system is bundled into a BodyDyn structure."

    "category": "section",
    "text": "Coupling scheme is refered to Wang and Eldredge JCP, detailes are skipped here. The main idea is to use fluid forces on body as the iterating variable, run the body solver Dyn3d with proposed fluid force as external force for the body-joint system, get updated body coordinates and velocities. Then use these information as boundary condition for fluid solver Whirl, get updated fluid force on body from Lagrange multipliers. If the proposed force and updated force are close enough, this timestep is said to be converged. Otherwise we use a relaxation scheme to calculate a new proposed force, iterates until it converge.There are several things that needs to be carefully dealt with, because we are using two packages together and variables need to be consistent from one to another."
