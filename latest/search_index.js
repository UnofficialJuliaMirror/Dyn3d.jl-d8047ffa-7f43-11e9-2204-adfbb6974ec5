    "text": "A 2d/3d rigid body dynamics solverThe main goal of this repository is to construct a rigid body-joint system and solve forward/backward dynamics problem on it. This package is functioned throughconstructing 2d/3d rigid body-joints system\nsolving motions on unconstrained degrees of freedom(passive joints) andforces on constrained degrees of freedom(active joints).plotting in Julia and making movies in MatlabTo solve a rigid body dynamics problem, this package express the dynamics using 6D spatial vector developed by Roy Featherstone. The governing equations are formulated to fit in half explicit Runge-Kutta method on index-2 differential equations. Constrained forces on joints are represented in Lagrange multiplier terms and solved together with motions of all degrees of freedom."
