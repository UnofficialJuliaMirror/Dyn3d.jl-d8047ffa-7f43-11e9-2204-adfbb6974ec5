This is the 3d dynamic chain solver using 6d spatial vector.

Code is written in Fortran and Julia on different branch.

branch **master** computes dynamics using articulated body method.

branch **HERK** computes dynamics formulating into a half-explicit Runge Kutta method solver.

branch **Julia** rewrites **HERK** in Julia.
